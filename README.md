# Python.io

Python.io is a modern take on the classic Snake game, developed using Processing 4.3 in Python mode. It features smooth gameplay and a minimalistic design, offering a fun and engaging experience for players of all ages.

## Game Overview

In Python.io, players control a snake on a grid, aiming to consume as much food as possible. Each piece of food the snake eats makes it grow longer, increasing the game's difficulty. The game ends if the snake collides with the grid walls or itself.

## Features

- Intuitive and engaging gameplay.
- Score tracking to monitor progress.
- Gradually increasing difficulty as the game progresses.
- "Play Again" feature for continuous play.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.
- Guide the snake to the food that appears randomly on the grid.
- Avoid collisions with the grid boundaries and the snake's body.
- The game ends upon collision, but you can click "Play Again" to restart.
